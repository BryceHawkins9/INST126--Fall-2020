Project 1

## First step: Create a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide using the "float" and "input" functions.
## Second step: Use the "if" conditional to create 4 separate functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. (Use numbers 1-4 to distinguish operators)
## Third step: Use "first_num", "second_num", and "solution" under each "if" conditional to satisfy each operator, then type "print" under solution.
## Fourth step: Hit "Run" and test calculator.
